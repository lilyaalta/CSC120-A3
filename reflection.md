Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
For this class I consolted my classmate Abby Dlug and this other lovely person that I cannot for the life of me remember their name at the moment.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended TA hours from feb 13-15 (or tue-thurs) and sunday on feb 18th.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's defenitely something I am having a bit of trouble in, I feel like I am already falling behind so I am going to put more effort into attended TA/ office hours so i can get back on track.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think python is a lot more "human friendly" if thats the correct usage. It was very much more laid back, while java gets angry with me if I forget a semi colon. Although java seems a lot more complicated, it's more intriguing. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My advice to someone taking this course is to take advantage of TA/ Office hours when you can. It might feel a bit scary or overwhelming but, in computer science, everyone is probably just as lost as you.
